# SmartStock AI – Multi-Agent Retail Inventory Optimization

![Hackathon Banner](img/image.png)

## Overview
**SmartStock AI** is a collaborative multi-agent system built to intelligently optimize retail inventory management. Designed during the **"Hack the Future: A Gen AI Sprint Powered by Data"** hackathon, it addresses critical retail challenges like stockouts, overstocking, and inefficient supply chains using intelligent agents and AI-driven forecasts.

By combining real-time collaboration and predictive AI, SmartStock AI dynamically balances product availability and inventory costs across stores, warehouses, and suppliers—ensuring smarter, faster, and leaner operations.

---

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses suffer from:

- **Stockouts** – Lost revenue from empty shelves 
- **Overstocking** – Excess inventory costs and space issues 
- **Manual Processes** – Delayed forecasting and inefficient operations 

**Our Goal**: Build an AI-powered, multi-agent system that automates demand prediction, inventory management, and price adjustment to boost efficiency and cut operational costs.

## The SmartStock AI System

The system is built around **five core agents**:

1. **Demand Prediction Agent**  
   Predicts future product demand using historical data, trends, and seasonality.

2. **Store Agent**  
   Tracks real-time inventory, requests restocks, and adjusts prices for slow-moving items.

3. **Warehouse Agent**  
   Allocates stock across stores and triggers restock requests to suppliers.

4. **Supplier Agent**  
   Coordinates product replenishment based on warehouse alerts and lead times.

5. **Customer Agent**  
   Learns customer preferences from anonymized data to refine predictions and promotions.

## Key Features

- **Proactive Restocking**: Anticipates needs before critical levels hit.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces overstocking through AI-aligned forecasting.  
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adapts pricing in real-time based on product demand and turnover.  
- **Real-Time Coordination**: Seamless communication among agents using shared state.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 
- Install dependencies: ```bash
pip install pandas ```  

### Folder Structure:
```bash
SmartStockAI/
├── data/
│   ├── demand_forecasting.csv
│   ├── inventory_monitoring.csv
│   └── pricing_optimization.csv
├── main.py
├── demand_agent.py

## How to Run
**1. Run the Simulation**
```bash
python main.py
```
This runs a step-by-step simulation where agents interact to manage demand and supply.

**2. Run the Database Demo**
```bash
python database.py
```
Demonstrates inventory updates using a local SQLite simulation.

---
## Code Components
- `main.py`: Controls simulation loop and orchestrates agent logic.

* `demand_agent.py`: Contains logic for each specific agent.

* `database.py`: Simulates real-time inventory updates in SQLite.
---
## Technical Stack
* **Language**: Python

* **Data Handling**: pandas

* **Database**: In-memory SQLite

* **AI Models**: Simple trend forecasting (extendable to LSTM or Ollama LLM)
---
## Expected Impact
* **Sales Boost**: 15–20% increase by preventing stockouts

* **Cost Savings**: 10–15% reduction in holding costs

* **Efficiency Gains**: 25% improvement in supply chain response time
---
## Future Enhancements
* Real-world data ingestion from APIs and POS systems

* Advanced AI (e.g., LSTM, Ollama, Graph Neural Nets)

* Integration with agent frameworks like SPADE or Mesa

* Web-based UI dashboard for live tracking (under maintanence)
